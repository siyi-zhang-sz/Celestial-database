# Celestial Database âœ¨

This project centers on astronomy, education, and entertainment. The primary goal is to represent and visualize the relationships of celestial bodies and space-related entities in an intuitive, user-friendly manner. By presenting relevant data (like orbits, physical properties, and historical facts), the application aims to pique curiosity and encourage further learning about our universe.
